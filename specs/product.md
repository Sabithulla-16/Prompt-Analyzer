# AI Tools Discovery Platform – Product Spec

## Problem
Users struggle to find the right AI tool for their exact task. Existing directories require browsing and guessing instead of understanding intent.

## Target User
Tech-aware students and developers who want to quickly find the best AI tool for a specific task.

## Core User Action
The user enters a natural language prompt describing their task.
The system analyzes the prompt and returns the top AI tools best suited for that task.

## Non-Goals
- Not building AI tools
- Not replacing chatbots like ChatGPT
- No user authentication in MVP
- No payments or subscriptions in MVP

## Success Metrics
- User clicks at least one suggested tool
- Prompt → tool relevance feels correct to the user

## Product Principle
Prompt understanding > tool quantity > UI polish
