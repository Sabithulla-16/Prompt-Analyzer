# Tool Data Validation Checklist

Before adding or approving any tool:

- Domain matches the tool’s main purpose
- Actions make sense for the domain
- Input and output types are realistic
- Use cases are clear and human-readable
- Tags are lowercase and consistent
- No empty or guessed fields

Rules:
- Quality > quantity
- If unsure, exclude the tool
- Bad data ruins AI recommendations
